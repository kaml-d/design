## Use Cases

`KAML-D` is mainly useful in the area of collaboratively developing and running cloud native Machine Learning (ML) apps, for example:

- As a *data scientist*, iterate on ML-based features faster and consequently ship them faster. Share models (incl. datasets and parameters) with team colleagues in a simple and intuitive way.
- As a *data engineer* or *developer*, you can benefit from the unified way of handling both datasets and models to more smoothly transition an app to production and interact with your fellow data scientists on the team.
- In an *ops* role, you can get the insights necessary to provide guidance to run the app (incl. the ML features) optimally.

### Faster machine learning iterations

Before an ML feature can be integrated into an app, a data scientist needs to:

1. come up with a model by choosing an approach and algorithm, for example, supervised learning with a [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) like the one available in [habrman/FaceRecognition](https://github.com/habrman/FaceRecognition), and
2. figure out how good good the model performs using, say, a [cost function](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-fundamentals-via-linear-regression-41a5d11f5220).
